# miband2control

I started to work on this project, because I would like to gain knowledge in Kotlin, and I would like to find new methods, and usages for Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).

First release of the project is in progress. ![in progress](http://willyminiatures.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/work-in-progress.png)
